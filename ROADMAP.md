### In flight 🔨

| Project | Progress | Next step |
|---|---|---|
| 🏙️ **Ottawa Case Study** (heat demand → electrification → grid) | `██████░░░` Phases 0–3 of 6 done | **Phase 4:** aggregate to 500 m grid + feeders, apply coincidence factor → [item 7](#7-ottawa-case-study--heat-demand-electrification-grid-in-progress) |

### Queued 🆕

Nothing queued — every planned tool has shipped. Next up is finishing the
in-flight Ottawa Case Study (below), then picking from the project ideas.

---

## 🎯 What's next — recommended order

1. **Ottawa Case Study Phases 4 → 5 → 6** (item 7). The only thing left on the
   board. Phase 4 is the defensibility step (coincidence factor — Phase 3
   proved the undiversified sums are upper bounds); Phase 6 is the public
   narrative page the whole project builds toward.
2. Once Phase 6 ships, pick from **Project ideas** below — nothing queued
   ahead of it.

**Small loose ends (fold into any session):**

- [ ] `Geothermal/scripts/build_building_demand.py` has the parquet-metadata
      clobbering bug Phase 3 fixed in its own writer — re-running Phase 2 today
      would silently destroy the `heatdemand_phase3` note (flagged 2026-07-17,
      still unfixed as of 2026-07-23).
- [ ] Watch first scheduled run: rates **2026-08-03**. (Construction's first run
      went green 2026-07-20; AHRI lookup is now a weekly automated refresh as of
      2026-07-22 — both resolved, no longer loose ends.)

## 7. Ottawa Case Study — heat demand, electrification, grid (in progress)

The end product is the **Ottawa Case Study**: a six-step narrative (grid
constraints → ground resource → building heat loads → electrified share →
electrification peak vs grid → candidate areas), delivered as a case-study page
with the interactive geothermal map as the expert explorer. Full plan + prompts:
**[HEATDEMAND_PLAN.md](HEATDEMAND_PLAN.md)** (§0 narrative, §5 paste-able
prompts). Build log: [GEOTHERMAL_STATUS.md](GEOTHERMAL_STATUS.md).

| Phase | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Source scouting memo | ✅ 2026-07-16 |
| 1 | Canonical building stock (414k buildings, height/type/vintage) | ✅ 2026-07-16 |
| 2 | Per-building current heat load + fuel | ✅ 2026-07-16 |
| 2.5 | Stock reconciliation — implied dwellings 1.005× census, sums defensible over `in_ottawa_cd` | ✅ 2026-07-17 |
| 3 | Electrified load per building (validated 0.00% vs shipped engine) | ✅ 2026-07-17 |
| **4** | **Aggregate → 500 m grid + feeder stress; apply coincidence factor from CCIM feeder loading** | 🔨 **next** |
| 5 | New map layers (demand, grid stress, intervention score) | 🆕 |
| 6 | The case-study page — the narrative deliverable | 🆕 |

Key Phase-3 findings that shape Phase 4 (details in GEOTHERMAL_STATUS.md):
the "average installed" ccASHP locks out at −15 °C so policy (a)'s design peak
is an equipment problem (Tier 1 halves it); the ~90% hybrid target is
unreachable with that curve (stalls at 81–84%); **the peak columns are
undiversified** — already-electric stock alone sums to 1,275 MW ≈ 98% of Hydro
Ottawa's system peak, so Phase 4 must derive a coincidence factor from real
feeder loading rather than quote raw sums.

## 💡 Project ideas (not committed — pick when the queue clears)

1. **EWRB Large-Buildings Explorer.** Ontario's Energy & Water Reporting
   Benchmark publishes *actual reported* energy + floor area + property type for
   every building ≥ 50k ft². Already identified as a heat-demand input
   (HEATDEMAND_PLAN §3.2); a standalone benchmarking page ("how does this
   office/MURB compare to its peers?") would be the suite's first
   *measured-data* tool and reuses the whole design system.
2. **Solar PV layer / explorer.** The ERS data already tracks PV adoption
   (retrofits.html measure flag); NRCan publishes municipal photovoltaic
   potential. Per-FSA adoption vs potential = "who's leaving sun on the table" —
   a natural sibling of the Retrofit Insights choropleths.
3. **Case-study template → second city.** Once Ottawa Case Study Phase 6 ships,
   the pipeline (footprints → stock → load → electrified peak vs feeders) is
   reusable wherever a utility publishes feeder capacity maps (several ON LDCs
   do under the same OEB CCIM mandate). A second city would prove the method
   generalizes.
4. **Bill comparator standalone.** The rates layer (`prices_json/` +
   `utility_rates_reference.json`) + heat pump engine could back a simple
   "what would switching cost *me*" page — narrower and more shareable than the
   full Heat Pump Explorer.
5. **EV charging load layer.** Same grid-stress framing as the case study's
   Phase 4: per-feeder added MW from EV adoption scenarios. Complements the
   heat-pump electrification story on the same GridCapacity polygons.

## Session hygiene

- Each prompt is self-contained; run in a fresh session, in order within an item.
- After each session: update the project's STATUS/METHODOLOGY file, flip the
  status board here, and commit.
- Opus for methodology-heavy or design-heavy work (silent-error risk); Sonnet
  for data plumbing with clear validation criteria.
- When an item completes: move its full text to
  [docs/archive/ROADMAP_COMPLETED.md](docs/archive/ROADMAP_COMPLETED.md) and
  keep one line in the Completed table.
